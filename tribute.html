            <p id="para1">"Intelligent life is the only thing that gives meaning to the universe. It is a holy thing, to be fostered and treasured.
                Without it nothing begins, nothing ends, there can be nothing through all eternity but the mindless babblings of chaos . . .
                Therefore, the nurture of all intelligent forms is a sacred duty. Even the merest spark of reason must be fanned in the hope of a flame. Frustrated intelligence must have its bonds broken. Narrow-channelled intelligence must be given the power to widen out. High intelligence must be learned from."
                 - Chocky 1968
