        <p id="bio"><b>Bio</b> - I have decided to take a career switch after 8 years in the science R&D industry to switch to a role in the tech industry. For this next step I have been pursuing online courses to give myself a grounding for a role in this new career. I have a fascination for systems and the critical analysis of problems that comes with the challenge of seeing a project to completion. For me the tech industry offers a wide variety of these where I can transfer my experience in managing and communicating STEM projects to clients. This has drawn me to front and back end development skills of being a web developer, with the desire to become a full stack developer due to the depth of expertise that can be acquired. Being able to  visualize the scope of all a client's requirements to achieve their goals is a role I want to be able to excel in.
